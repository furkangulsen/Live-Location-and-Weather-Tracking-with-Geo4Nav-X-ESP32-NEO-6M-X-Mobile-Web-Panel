# ðŸš€ Geo4Nav â€” Real-Time GPS Tracking & Weather Monitoring System (Embedded System)

## About the Project

This project utilizes an **ESP32**-based microcontroller and a **NEO-6M GPS module** to provide real-time location tracking, instant map visualization, weather information retrieval, and data logging to the **ThingSpeak** platform.

Designed with embedded systems principles, the solution optimizes resource usage for low power consumption and stable wireless connectivity, ensuring reliable performance in IoT environments.

With the system we developed;

- **Real-time GPS location is tracked on the map.**  
- **Instant location is viewed via a Flutter-based mobile app and a web panel.**  
- **Weather information is retrieved based on your current location.**  
- **Data is automatically logged to the ThingSpeak channel for analysis.**
